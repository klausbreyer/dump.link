# Title: Use of Single Server Instance for Application Scaling

## Status

Accepted

## Context

I am developing an application requiring real-time synchronization of data across different user sessions. Several approaches were considered to handle real-time data updates and synchronization, focusing on factors like complexity, scalability, and resource management. The key options evaluated included:

1. **WebSockets with Multiple Server Instances:** Implementing real-time data synchronization using WebSockets across multiple server instances, involving either server-to-server communication or integration with a message broker like Redis.

2. **Database Triggers and Polling:** Using database triggers to log changes and polling these logs from the application to avoid complex inter-server communication.

3. **Binary Replication Streams:** Streaming database changes using binary replication logs from MySQL, with services like Maxwell or Debezium to capture and forward database events.

4. **Single Server Instance with Resource Scaling:** Operating a single server instance and scaling its resources as needed, focusing on simplicity and avoiding the initial complexity of handling multiple instances.

Additionally, I anticipate future challenges such as global scaling for users collaborating across different regions like the USA and Europe, requiring rapid and efficient data synchronization globally.

## Decision

I have decided to use a single server instance for the application. This decision prioritizes simplicity and avoids the initial complexity associated with managing real-time data synchronization across multiple server instances.

A single server instance approach allows for consistent data management and reduces the overhead associated with more sophisticated synchronization methods. I believe in the efficiency of a single Go server, which can be quite powerful and capable of handling significant loads. This decision will be revisited as the application grows and scales, at which point more advanced approaches may be considered to handle increased load and user concurrency, especially for global scaling needs.

## Consequences

1. **Simplicity in Implementation:** A single server instance simplifies implementation and maintenance, reducing initial development complexity and allowing focus on other critical application features.

2. **Resource Scaling:** The server can undergo vertical scaling by adding more resources as the load increases. However, there are limits to this approach, and horizontal scaling might be necessary in the future.

3. **Potential Bottlenecks:** With user base growth, the single server instance could become a bottleneck. This approach might not be suitable for handling high concurrency levels and large volumes of real-time data, especially in a global context.

4. **Easier Debugging and Monitoring:** With just one instance, monitoring and debugging the application will be more straightforward, potentially leading to easier maintenance and quicker issue resolution.

5. **Future Considerations:** If the application becomes successful and the load exceeds the capabilities of a single server instance, I will need to revisit this decision. Potential future solutions could include adopting a more scalable architecture with multiple server instances and a message broker or a more sophisticated data synchronization mechanism, especially to address global scaling challenges.
