		<!-- Content Paragraphs with Tailwind CSS -->
		<p class="my-2">
			The Kanban assembly line model addresses reactive work. This is not what dumplink is about. Dumplink is a lightweight tool designed for creative problem-solving teams doing planned project work—teams that shape ideas on a conceptual design track to ensure a meaningful solution is considered and solved at the right level of detail before pulling it into development.
		</p>
		<p class="my-2">
			Scrum teams groom backlogs and assign scattered pieces of work to different people through sprint planning. This is not what Dumplink is about either. Dumplink is for teams who want to bet on current and well-shaped ideas. It is for teams that want to get self-contained projects completed and off their plate and increase the optionality for doing new things in subsequent development cycles. Dumplink is for implementation teams that typically work with appetites, not sprint estimates across disjointed tickets, own individual projects, and come up with their own tasks using the project outline to maintain context.
		</p>
		<p class="my-2">
			Too many project management tools are designed around abhorrent ways of working models that are simply not ideal for creative problem-solving, are bloated and overly complicated, and distract teams from focusing on figuring out a discrete block of work and getting it done.

			This ends now…with dumplink!
		</p>
		<p class="my-2">
			We need a common map that helps teams delegate bounded projects, not tasks, and improve how teams collaborate with each other when in the context of development and design to effectively course correct as the work unfolds. Delegation and implementation teams also need a tool that makes everyone a partner in the process of chunking up a project so those who shape and delegate projects can improve their upstream conceptual design and spiking skills.
		</p>

			Say hello to reliable project hand-offs, smooth kick-offs and fixed-time-variable-scope build cycles, seamless communication, and shipping high-quality work.

		<p class="my-2">
			Say goodbye to burnout, over-indexing on local maximums, and directionless planning.

		<h1 class="my-4 text-2xl font-bold text-center">How to Use It and Work Like a Pro</h1>

		<!-- Ordered List with Tailwind CSS -->
		<ol class="my-4 space-y-2 list-decimal list-inside">
			<li><strong>Create.</strong> Make a new [dump.link].</li>
			<li><strong>Configure.</strong> State how much time is worth spending on the project (appetite) using the dumplink progress bar meter tool and the team members allocated to the project.</li>
			<li><strong>Kick-off.</strong> The programmer(s) and designer (“Small Launch Team”) kick off the project cycle and read the shaped project outline document together and chat with the shaper(s) who packaged the work to be developed.</li>
			<li><strong>Dump.</strong> The Small Launch Team dumps everything they think they will have to do into the dump. This helps the team consider the package of shaped work as a whole by turning the whole thing into rough implementation tasks without concerning themselves with structure and order before starting on any one area.</li>
			<li><strong>Task Grouper.</strong> The Small Launch Team drags these initial tasks into unnamed groups by asking themselves: "What can be completed together and in isolation from the rest?". Task group boxes are named after the Small Launch Team clusters the tasks and looks at the actual work to ensure the task groups show real relationships in the work and not arbitrary categories. The Small Launch Team considers which task groups have risky unknowns and flags them. Seeing all the groups together helps to do this because the question of "what is unknown" is relative.</li>
			<li><strong>Task Group Sequencer.</strong> The Task Group Sequencer lets the Small Launch Team draw an arrow from one task group to another illustrating the causal structure of how things are connected. Additionally, the Task Group Sequencer lets teams know when they have the required inputs completed that the next task group needs.</li>
			<li><strong>Task Group Arranger.</strong> Dumplink recognizes task groups with more outgoing than incoming connections so teams know where to start building and solving problems first. The Task Group Arranger helps the Small Launch Team easily see what has to be done first in terms of dependencies and unknowns but also lets teams sort, e.g., by ease/effort, and move them up or down in the arrangement layer stack.</li>
			<li><strong>Risk Ratios and Appetite Timepiece.</strong> During this process, teams are tracking their work using the simplified Risk Ratios and Appetite Timepiece: Teams can track phases between “Figuring out”, “Figured out”, and “Done” states all while start and end dates for each piece are automatically created. Additionally, progress states auto-switch depending on progress across a task group bucket to create less process management work for teams while maintaining transparency about risk and movement.</li>
